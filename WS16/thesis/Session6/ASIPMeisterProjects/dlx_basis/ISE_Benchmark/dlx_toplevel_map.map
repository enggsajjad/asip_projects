Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   998 out of  17,280    5%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        3,490
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         1,498 out of   3,490   42%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 230 out of   3,490    6%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:       1,762 out of   3,490   50%
    Number of unique control sets:              46
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              22 out of  69,120    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

    Number using BlockRAM only:                  1
    Total primitives used:
      Number of 18k BlockRAM used:               1
    Total Memory used (KB):                     18 out of   5,328    1%
