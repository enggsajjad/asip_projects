ModelSim:
(1) Configure the CPU Frequency for which you want to run the power estimation. Open the
ModelSim testbench (tb_ASIPmeister.vhd), search for CLK_HALF_PERIOD, and
change the value accordingly. Take care: For simulation-reasons this value corresponds
to the time (in nano seconds) of a half clock period. For example, 10 ns half period cor-
respond to 20 ns clock period, which is 50 MHz frequency.
(2) Compile the project Compile  > Compile Order  > Auto Generate
(3) Start the simulation: VSIM > vsim -t 1ns work.cfg
(4) Store the activities during the program execution in the test.vcd file by typing:
VSIM > vcd file test.vcd
(5) Add all signals of the CPU instance: VSIM > vcd add -r test/dut/*
(6) Run the simulation: VSIM > run -all
