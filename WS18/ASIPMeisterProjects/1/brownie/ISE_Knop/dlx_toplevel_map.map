Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    0
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                    40 out of  69,120    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                  40
  Number of Slice LUTs:                         55 out of  69,120    1%
    Number used as logic:                       54 out of  69,120    1%
      Number using O6 output only:              54
    Number used as exclusive route-thru:         1
  Number of route-thrus:                         1
    Number using O6 output only:                 1

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    23 out of  17,280    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           61
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            21 out of      61   34%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   6 out of      61    9%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          34 out of      61   55%
    Number of unique control sets:               6
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              12 out of  69,120    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        17 out of     640    2%
    Number of LOCed IOBs:                       17 out of      17  100%

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      1 out of      32    3%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        1

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                4.62

Peak Memory Usage:  401 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  59 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   39 secs
