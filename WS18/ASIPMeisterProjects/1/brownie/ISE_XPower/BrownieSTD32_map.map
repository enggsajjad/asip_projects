    Number used as Latch-thrus:                  2
  Number of Slice LUTs:                      2,825 out of  69,120    4%
    Number used as logic:                    2,824 out of  69,120    4%
      Number using O6 output only:           2,579
      Number using O5 output only:              29
      Number using O5 and O6:                  216
    Number used as exclusive route-thru:         1
  Number of route-thrus:                        30

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                 1,106 out of  17,280    6%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        3,636
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         1,821 out of   3,636   50%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 811 out of   3,636   22%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:       1,004 out of   3,636   27%
    Number of unique control sets:              43
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              19 out of  69,120    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                       171 out of     640   26%

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      1 out of      32    3%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        1

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                4.74

Peak Memory Usage:  440 MB
