answers:
Exercise 1:
a) 190 times

Exercise 2:
a) BubbleSort_Index.c:
    - no exchange: 2 loads, 0 stores
    - exchange: 4 loads, 2 stores (if compiler is not
too stupid: 2 loads)
   BubbleSort_Address.c:
    - no exchange: 1 load, 0 stores
    - exchange: 1 load, 2 stores
 1. The "Address" version remembers the next j value
for the next iteration,
    so it only needs one read per no exchange loop
 2. The "Address" version doesn't read the values of
the array again in the
    "exchange" case, so it doesn't need additional
loads

Exercise 3:
 a) The execution needs 3435 cycles

Exercise 4:
 a) dlxsim needed 6736 cycles and ModelSim 6737 cycles

Exercise 5:
 a) The execution needs 5250 cycles
 b) 128,3 % speedup
